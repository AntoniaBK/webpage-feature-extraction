# Webpage Feature Extractor

This is a tool for creating a dataset using [Lookyloo](https://github.com/Lookyloo/lookyloo) captures.

## Installation

1. clone the repository
2. install dependencies using poetry

## Usage

Adapt the source folders of main.py accordingly. Currently it is made for extracting from the downloaded captures that are all in a folder. The folder names will be saved as tags in the dataset.
